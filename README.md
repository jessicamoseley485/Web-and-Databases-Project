This is a Web and Databases Project undertaken as part of the 'Web and Database Systems' module at the University of Surrey.

The project involved the creation of a MySQL database, as well as complex SQL queries written to retrieve and edit data within the database. It also involved the creation of a web front-end to the database using NodeJS that allowed users to read from and write to the database.
